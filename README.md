### To HAB59 staff: Please see the folder "Versions" for our older commits throughout the work. The other folders contain the final app files uploaded later.

Deep Learning solutions for retailers to help retain customers by providing a smart interface and other services. Work by Sarthak Rastogi and Aditi Singhal for HAB59 2020.

The application takes in video input from CCTV cameras to perform facial recognition on customers to identify them if they are regular customers or add their record if they are new, and also to determine features from their appearance while tracking their purchases to recommend them similar products. The app further goes on to detect credit card fraud at the check-out, hence providing a complete business solution to small businesses.

For building and running the apps we used an Anaconda Environment and Anaconda Prompt. The command line may also be used. It requires the installation of, along with Python 3, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, Flask and TensorFlow Keras. Change directories to the one containing the app you want to run and use the command 
$ Python app.py
to run.
